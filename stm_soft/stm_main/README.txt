Skeleton is generated by STM32CubeMX v5.3.0.

toolchain is from STM32 Cores by STMicroelectronics v1.7.0 installed into Arduino IDE v1.8.10.

Drivers and Middlewares folders are omitted from git repo.

env.sh file sets environment variables needed for build.

Looks like for Makefile based project "Regenerate code" parses preexisting Makefile in the wrong way.
So before regenerating delete current makefile, press "generate code" and add back lines with custom
sources at the end of file.
